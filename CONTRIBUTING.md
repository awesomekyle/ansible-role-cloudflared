Any contribution is welcome and there is not much to consider but

1. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

   Ensure you have no typos and a proper description, use [optional body]` to describe details. All this will automatically go into the `CHANGELOG.md` when a release is created.
  
2. Always update documentation i.e. `README.md`

Thanks to everybody, who takes time to make contributions, I really appreciate it.
